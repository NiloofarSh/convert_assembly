Using the REST API 

REST provides the following advantages when compared to SOAP:

1. REST is easier to use for the most part and is more flexible.
2. Uses easy to understand standards like swagger and OpenAPI Specification 3.0
3. Smaller learning curve
4. Efficient (SOAP uses XML for all messages, REST mostly uses smaller message formats like JSON)
5.Fast (no extensive processing required)
6. Closer to other Web technologies in design philosophy


SOAP provides the following advantages when compared to REST:

1. Language, platform, and transport independent (REST requires use of HTTP)     
2. Works well in distributed enterprise environments (REST assumes direct point-to-point communication)
3.Standardized
4.Provides significant pre-build extensibility in the form of the WS* standards
5.Built-in error handling
6.Automation when used with certain language products
